# E-DES

The primary objective of this project is to develop an upgraded iteration of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) within the context of cryptographic enhancements.

This project seeks to address two key shortcomings of DES: the algorithm's inherent software performance inefficiencies and the limited key size. To achieve these objectives, we will retain the fundamental cipher architecture of DES while departing from its traditional reliance on permutations. Instead, we will utilize a 256-bit key to generate randomized S-Boxes.
